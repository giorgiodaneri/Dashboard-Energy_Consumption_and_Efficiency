# Dashboard-Energy_Consumption_and_Efficiency
A dashboard programmed in Python. Topics covered are energy consumption and efficiency all over the world. We selected a few Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate carbon footprint and energetic sustainability for the major countries in the world.

The dashboard consists of four graphs. 
- The choropleth represents the energy mix of all the major countries in the world. The user can select the energy source of interest and check which countries rely upon it more.  
- The bar chart shows CO2 emissions for several countries. The values shown are two: global share and emissions per capita
- The box plot represents LCOE values for different energy sources and at different discount rates
- The scatter renders LCOE values based on the selected country. Each dot corresponds to a specific project, whose characteristics are shown in the hover text

# How to make it work on your device
First of all, you will need to change the path to the datasets in the Dashboard.py file with their actual location on your memory. Then you will probably need to adjust values in the css file in order to fit your monitor resolution.
